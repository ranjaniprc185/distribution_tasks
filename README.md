Task 1:

Perform a statistical analysis to determine whether daily call counts follow a Poisson distribution.
Your analysis should include:
1.Load the dataset and display the first few rows along with summary statistics.
2.Plot the distribution of daily calls.
3.Calculate the mean call count (λ).
4.Overlay the Poisson Probability Mass Function (PMF) using the sample mean.
5.Compare the actual distribution with the theoretical Poisson curve.

Description

This task demonstrates the use of probability theory to check whether a real-world dataset fits a Poisson distribution, which is often used for modelling count-based events.
You will:
1.Analyze daily call frequencies
2.Visualize empirical data
3.Fit a mathematical Poisson model
4.Compare observed vs expected values
5.This helps identify whether the process generating the data follows a Poisson pattern.

Task 2:

Using your own dataset, demonstrate the concept of the Normal Distribution by:
1.Selecting any numerical column
2.Visualizing the distribution with a histogram
3.Plotting a best-fit normal curve over the histogram
4.Calculating descriptive statistics:
Mean,Standard deviation
5.Interpreting whether the data appears normally distributed

Description:
This task shows how real-world data behaves with respect to a Gaussian (Normal) distribution, the most important concept in statistics.
You will:
1.Plot distribution curves
2.Compare actual vs theoretical normal distribution
3.Understand how mean and standard deviation shape the curve
4.Identify symmetry, spread, and skew
5.This is a foundational skill in machine learning, hypothesis testing, and analytics.
